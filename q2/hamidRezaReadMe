hello
this is a short explenation about this part of Opration System Project.
this is about how to add a system call in xv6 os.  
if you dont know what exactly a system call is you should go and read about it
if you dont do that you probably face some dificulties.
as you can see in xv6 directory there is so many files like syscall.h , syscall.c , defs.h and etc.
you should change and modified some files in order to add system calls in xv6 OS.
those files are:
syscall.h
syscall.c
sysproc.c
usys.S
user.h

first you must change syscall.h
this file contains the list of system calls in xv6 os
the number that is in front of each system call is the ID of that specefic system call.
for example you want to add a getchildren system call in xv6
when you open this syscall.h file you see some #defines
if it is the first time you opeen this file you will see 21 syscalls that ends with
#define SYS_close 21
so we can undrestand some fact from this file
1) there is 21 orginal system call in xv6
2) if you want to add a system call in this OS first define your system call on this file like blow:
#define SYS_getchildren [ID of your system call]
#define SYS_getchildren 22

next yu must modified syscall.c file
first add the prototype of your system call
extern int sys_getchildren(void)
then add the system call in syscall structure
[SYS_getchildren] sys_getchildren,
